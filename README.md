# QSARPlasmaHalfLife

This repository contains the final model file and the data file for the AI-QSAR model to predict plasma half-lives of drugs in six common food animal species, including cattle, swine, sheep, goats, chickens, and turkeys.

The model code can be executed using Google Colab. To reproduce or apply this model, readers/users can run each block of the code step by step. The code file contains detailed annotation to help understand the function of each block of the code.

The final model has been converted to a web dashboard (the link is available in the manuscript). Users can simply visit this web dashboard to apply this model.

The title of the manuscript describing this project is “Development of Artificial Intelligence-Based Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship Models for Predicting Plasma Half-Lives of Drugs in Six Common Food Animal Species”. This manuscript is under review.
